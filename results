I need you guys to please direct me and teach me what you experienced and what you really believe on these following questions in mind:**\n\n1. Is Scala a good career? (thinking even if you discontinue from Scala and start building in other languages, is it still a good choice and will it help to transition easily ?)\n   1. Asking my first question because, everywhere online there were so many blogs and comments and videos saying Java will be dead by the year 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018.... None of this was true and is true, if somebody asks me, I would say Java is never going to die.\n2. What comes to your mind when people ask you what is that one thing you can do in Scala that you cant do in any other language? Is it web development ? Is it backend programming for highly scalable apps? Is it for Data Analysis? Is it for Data Science?\n3. Anybody here with 6+ years of experience in Scala who is only doing Scala and living Scala for an  organisation like Google, MS, Apple, PayPal, Wallmart etc etc and was not required to do any other coding at all. (excluding people who contribute directly to Scala &amp; related open source communities)\n4. What is that one thing you recommend doing in Scala to beginners that immediately results in your creation (for example: if it was for JS or Python I would recommend building a website, we would feel confident after seeing the work done and things learnt throughout)\n5. I feel like people who have started of with Java are only ruling the market of backend programming, If i am wrong please justify and let me know your story of turning the stone. (keeping the Web development off the topic because of plethora of things there which would not be a fit here)\n6. Any resources for learning Scala in a practical manner, probably by building an app by plagiarising things (with permission) already built.\n   1. **I am currently reading Programming in Scala (did all exercises and need to start with chapter 8 today) written by Martin Odersky &amp; Bill Venners.**\n7. Anything else that you want to share with me and the community.\n\n***&lt;/questions&gt;***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMay god bless with happy days and career to all the people out there who are struggling through tough times and to people who have been helping them by caring and sharing knowledge and building great things for free.\n\n**PS: Programming in Scala is an amazing book so far. I am getting the hang of it. (afraid of higher-kinded types though, let us see how will that go in upcoming lessons)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Please upvote this post, so that we can get this to everybody to evaluate and result the comment type for our method call.

{"selftext":"Hello,\n\nI built an app with Akka HTTP and Slick that does basic CRUD and websockets. I had what looked like a memory leak in production with little traffic so I fired it up locally, no traffic, with VisualVM. It looks like it's starting at 73MB used heap and increasing linearly at a rate of about 16MB/minute until it reaches the max heap size. It's not all being used as I am able to garbage collect.
